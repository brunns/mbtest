# To Do

* What if Mountebank is installed elsewhere? We should emit better messages if starting the mb server fails, and make the location configurable. This could be as simple as parameterising it. 
* Does the TCP protocol stuff work? I need to add `endOfRequestResolver` I think, at least.
* Proxy record/playback
* Test for saving & rehydrating imposters from file.
* Tutorial & guide
* Fix email matcher
* `had_request()` matcher for imposters - deprecate server version?
* CONTRIBUTING.md
