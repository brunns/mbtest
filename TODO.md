# To Do

* Docstrings, [readthedocs](https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation.html) through [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example/documentation.html#sphinx).
* What if Mountebank is installed elsewhere? We should emit better messages if starting the mb server fails, and make the location configurable. This could be as simple as parameterising it. 
* [Type checking](https://mypy.readthedocs.io).
